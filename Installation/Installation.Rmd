1.Top LEFT: the **editor** where you edit scripts and documents and can “send” code to run in the console,

---

2.Top RIGHT: your **environment/history** panes. This is where you can see variables you’ve created and a full history of functions / commands you have run,

---

3.Bottom RIGHT: The bottom right pane by default contains several panes including: **files/plots/packages/help/viewer**. The files pane allows you to explore files on your computer like you would in windows explorer or finder on a mac. The plots tab is where you will see plots that you create. We will explore these various panes together in class.

---

4.Bottom LEFT: the **R console** is where the code is run. You can type code directly into the console OR you can send it to the console by running it from the editor. The placement of these panes and their content can be customized using the RStudio preferences: (From the RStudio drop down choose: **RStudio -> Preferences -> Pane Layout**). You can also drag the panes using your mouse to move / resize them.)
